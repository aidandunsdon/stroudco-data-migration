  long_description: M.. Cottage took over from Cookes Coffee & Curios in November
    2014.  The enterprise started life in Brunel Mall in the latter stages of 2013.  Recognising
    that great coffee is appreciated in Stroud, the dream began. We also work with
    local artists, working on a reasonable commission basis. We are focused on providing
    great service with the highest levels of customer satisfaction – we will do everything
    we can to meet your expectations. With a variety of offerings to choose from,
    we’re sure you’ll enjoy visiting us. Look around our website www.cookescoffeecurios.com
    and if you have any comments or questions, please feel free to contact us.  Check
    back later for new updates to our website. There’s much more to come!
